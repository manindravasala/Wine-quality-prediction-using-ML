# Wine-quality-prediction-using-ML
This project predicts wine quality using machine learning, specifically the Random Forest algorithm. By analyzing physicochemical properties of wine—such as acidity, sugar, pH, and alcohol content—the model estimates quality scores provided by experts. The workflow includes data preprocessing with pandas and numpy, data visualization.

This project, "Wine Quality Prediction using Machine Learning," aims to develop a predictive model to assess the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties. The core objective is to classify wines into distinct quality categories (e.g., good, bad) by leveraging a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset contains various chemical attributes, such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol content.

The project begins with an extensive data preprocessing phase using the Pandas and NumPy libraries in Python. This involves handling missing values, standardizing data, and preparing the features for model training. The preprocessed data is then split into an 80-20 ratio, where 80% is designated as the training set and 20% as the testing set.

This split ensures that the model is trained on a substantial portion of the data while being validated on unseen data to prevent overfitting.
The predictive model is built using the Random Forest algorithm, a powerful ensemble learning method known for its high accuracy and robustness. The Random Forest algorithm works by constructing multiple decision trees and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes of the individual trees. By tuning the hyperparameters of the Random Forest model, we can enhance its predictive power and achieve higher accuracy in classifying the wine quality.

Matplotlib is used throughout the project for data visualization, allowing for insightful exploration of the dataset's characteristics and the relationships between different chemical attributes and wine quality. This visual analysis helps in understanding the data better and making informed decisions during the modeling process. The final model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting wine quality.
