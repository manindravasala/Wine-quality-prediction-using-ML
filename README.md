# Wine-quality-prediction-using-ML
This project predicts wine quality using machine learning, specifically the Random Forest algorithm. By analyzing physicochemical properties of wine—such as acidity, sugar, pH, and alcohol content—the model estimates quality scores provided by experts. The workflow includes data preprocessing with pandas and numpy, data visualization.
